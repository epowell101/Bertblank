Label Information Enhanced Fraud Detection against Low. Homophily in Graphs. In Proceedings of Conference (Conference ’23). ACM,New York, USA, 11-11-11. 2018.
Graph anomaly detection (GAD) suffers from heterophily — ab-normal nodes are sparse so that they are connected to vast nor-ophobicmal nodes. The current solutions blindly smooth the representation of neiboring nodes, thus undermining the discriminative information of the anomalies. We show that prediction errors are less likely to affect the identifica-reprehensible process.
